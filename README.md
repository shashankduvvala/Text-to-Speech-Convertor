This project is a Text-to-Speech Converter built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to input text, select a voice (male or female), and adjust the speech speed before converting text into speech. The system utilizes pyttsx3 for offline speech synthesis and gTTS for online text-to-speech conversion.
